# Go Starter kit

Setting up my own Go starter kit featuring:

- [x] Docker containers to compile, run and expose the application(s)
- [x] Docker Compose to start all apps and setup networking between them as needed
- [x] `realize` to auto-recompile (and install dependencies as introduced!) on code changes

Plan to add:

- [ ] Some more examples (AKA: starter kits)
- [ ] Integration with other(s) e.g: Prometheus, Redis, etc.
